# Usage notes

This directory contains sources files needed to run Codeception tests on a testing system.

1. Copy this directory into a folder in your project
2. Rename the .phps files to .php
3. Run a dev/build and create the relevant pages in the CMS

## TODO

Find a better way to do this or automate it, e.g an installable module via composer require-dev
